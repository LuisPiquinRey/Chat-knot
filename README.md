## 📖 Overview

**Chat-Knot** is a **real-time communication platform** built with **ASP.NET Core** and **SignalR**, leveraging **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **microservices architecture** principles.  
It provides a scalable foundation for event-driven chat applications with modular bounded contexts, supporting user messaging, presence tracking, and distributed communication flows.

### 🧩 Key Architectural Features

- **Real-Time Messaging** via SignalR  
- **Microservices Architecture** with independent bounded contexts  
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** for modular and maintainable domain logic  
- **Event-Driven Communication** using message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka)  
- **API Gateway** for unified access and authentication  
- **Containerized Deployment** with Docker and optional Kubernetes orchestration

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8.0, SignalR  
- **Architecture:** Microservices, DDD, Event-Driven  
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ / Kafka (planned)  
- **Data Storage:** SQL Server / MongoDB (polyglot persistence)  
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes (optional)  

---

## 📦 Project Goals

- Build a **modular, scalable** chat system using clean architecture and DDD  
- Explore **real-time event orchestration** in distributed systems  
- Serve as a **reference project** for SignalR-based microservices integration
